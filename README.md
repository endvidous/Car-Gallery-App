# React + Vite Car Gallery App Progect

This app was made using react and jsx. It includes the most common routing method and pagination. It shows
the implementation between pages, and data that are in the source folder itself. 
It is a beginner app so it doesn't include much functionality but it works very well for the amount of time 
invested on the project
